This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.


## Summary of Findings

> The Borrower's APR plot shows that the Borrower's APR has it's highest peak at 0.36, the second highest peak is at 0.3. Only very few loans have APR greater than 0.4.

>I noticed there are three loan terms borrowers use. Majority of borrowers prefer the 36 months term (3years) while other go for the 60 months term (5 years).

> The most popular reasons for the borrowers to take a loan is for Debt Consolidation, followed by Baby& Adoption.

> I observed that the Stated Monthly Income is peaked at 5,000. The plot shows that very borrowers have a stated income of over 20,000.

> With the Original Loan amount plot, As original Loan amount increases the Borrower APR reduces. Loan amounts between 1 to 5000 has the highest Borrower APR..
